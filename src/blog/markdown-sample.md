Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`.

Itemized lists look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

## h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Here's a code block sample:

```css
/* Display message for old browsers only */
@supports (--css: variables) {
  .browsercheck-message {
    display: none;
  }
}
@supports not (--css: variables) {
  .browsercheck-message {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients

- 1st ingredient
- 2nd ingredient
- 3rd ingredient

2.  Boil some water
3.  Dump everything in the pot and prey

Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

#### h4 header

Here's a markdown link to [a website](https://www.artisanweb.dev) but we can't see it's external.

Here's a html link to <a href="https://www.artisanweb.dev" rel="external">a website</a> with external indication.
